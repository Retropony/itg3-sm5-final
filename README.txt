Welcome to the new version of the ITG3 theme port for StepMania 5, originally made for OpenITG by Lightning and ported by AJ Kelly.

The original project can be found here: https://github.com/freem/itg3theme

We'll try to finish the theme, abandoned since 2 years, and make it working with StepMania 5.0 and, later, StepMania 5.1.

The theme is in Themes\itg3\.
Most of the porting work has been done by AJ Kelly (so far).
Midiman was planning on working on achievements.

NoteSkins from ITG3 are available in NoteSkins\dance\.
They were ported by Jousway.
Metal2 was not included since Jousway said it was similar to Metal+.
Check out his site, Unlimited Stepman Works: http://zettbou.co.uk/
(metal+ is available there. check _Noteskin/SM5/Dance/.)

The OpenITG materials are in the oitg\ folder.
